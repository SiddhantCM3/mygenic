                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">The global pharmaceutical sector has been pressed to handle the supply of medicines and treatments in response to the coronavirus epidemic. Demands and supplies were severely limited in the initial months of the pandemic due to the installation of the lockdown. However, India, as the world’s largest provider of pharmaceuticals, has reduced limitations on pharmaceutical exports to developing countries, particularly in cases when certain medicines are in high demand.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">Using medicine, technology, and assistance to lend a helping hand India’s MyGenic Healthcare helped to giving medical assistance to countries affected by COVID-19. India’s government also provided technical support to countries which are in need by assigning a fast reaction team in the event of an emergency. e-ITEC (Indian Technical & Economic Cooperation) has conducted a number of webinars around the country to explore the necessary measures for dealing and containing the epidemic by analyzing and exchanging experiences. The purpose of these webinars was to develop best practices by speaking with professionals from around the world.</p>
