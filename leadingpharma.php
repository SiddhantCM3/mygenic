                <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">How We became a Top Leading Pharmaceutical Export Company?</h3>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">In recent years, developments in the pharmaceutical company model have compelled leaders to invest in innovative marketing methods. However, the majority of these New Commercial Models (NCMs) have become a flop. The demise of the formerly tactical, effective sales consultant-to-doctor model is a source of worry for pharmaceutical export sales tactics. The rapidly changing industry has discovered that classic sales methods are not effective anymore. Instead of introducing new strategies, many organizations alter their old systems to adapt to changing markets.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">Create a customer-centric culture: Leading companies like MyGenic are pharmaceutical companies that have taken a customer-centric approach to examine the value offered for each major consumer category to flourish in the toughest environment. Companies must make efforts to build unique forms of customer connection for each consumer group throughout the supply chain, if they are practicing physicians, direct patients, or channel partners, by consolidating field force, improving mechanisms of sales force engagements, adopting digital marketing, strengthening market channels, and organizing patient education programs. Companies should not only sell their products, but also consider themselves as health prevention and management organization.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">Broad portfolios are well-known to be the main cornerstones of success. These portfolios were created by leading manufacturing, research, and development investors, as well as mergers. On comparing product portfolios with the competitors, many are not great. In most cases, innovative financing options for intangibles do not exist.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">In this competitive environment, licensing property rights across many markets allows for better profitability. Some corporations lack the financial resources that are required to file medication registration applications in target countries. The costs of drug registration in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe, among other places, are extremely high (the registration costs are 50 -200 times more than in developing nations).</p>

                <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">What Helped Us to become the Top Leading Pharmaceutical Exporting Company?</h3>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">Only significant actions implemented at the right moment will assist in achieving this, as will the accessibility of the best skills at lower prices. Because of a severe lack of connections between governmental institutions, academia, and industry, there are hardly any formal initiatives to decrease innovation potential. Establishing a larger skilled populace is necessary for the industryâ€™s growth and survival. Several firms have a shortage of skilled workers, which raises the costs of manufacturing and innovation. Some countries profit from a combination of dedicated talents and low expenses. The cost of relevant manpower, such as researchers, production personnel, regulatory affairs, foreign business development personnel, and pharmaceutical lawyers, is rapidly increasing.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">Only a few players gain from globalization ability and exports. Some pharmaceutical businesses lack competence in functionalization, facilities management, operation, copyright creation, legal acumen, worldwide market understanding, expertise in handling multinational executives, or knowledge of international regulatory affairs. Even though there are loads of companies, there is a significant scarcity of necessary skill sets, which drives up expenses. If players are required to comply with international standards, the industry will develop many competent workers in R&D, regulatory affairs, and production, outpacing wage cost increases.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">MyGenic is <strong>WHO</strong> & <strong>GMP</strong> (Good manufacturing practices) certified by <strong>World Health Organization</strong> as mentioned above, which makes the company a leader in third-party manufacturing for many clients from across the globe. MyGenic is also certified by Pharmexcil (Pharmaceuticals export promotion council of India) and MACCIA (Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture), which makes the brand more transparent in operations and services within and outside the organization.</p>
